<!--
This is the website for Girls Who Code @ Georgia Tech. Please make a branch to edit the website from and do not edit directly on master.
When you are ready to push your changes to the master branch, let Jinny or Wendy know so we can review you code. We will confirm the push from our end.
!! IMPORTANT !! Remember to pull from master each time before you start editing things so you don't accidentally overwrite other peoples' work.
Let us know if you have any questions!
